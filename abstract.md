# Abstract
In this study, we explore the potential of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) for improving Arabic Handwritten Digit image recognition by generating synthetic images along with their corresponding labels. Our research focuses on comparing the performance of two widely-used loss functions: the conventional GAN loss function and the Wasserstein loss function. We modify the GAN and WGAN architectures to produce labels for the generated images, enabling us to use these synthetic images and their labels to enhance image recognition tasks. 

We employ a three-pronged approach to evaluate and compare the efficacy of both loss functions. First, we generate synthetic Arabic Handwritten Digit images using the modified GAN and WGAN models. Next, we assess the quality of these generated images using established evaluation metrics, such as Inception Score and Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID). Finally, we investigate the improvements in image recognition achieved by incorporating these synthetic datasets into the original dataset and training classifiers on the augmented data. 

Additionally, we examine the correlation between synthetic image quality and recognition performance to understand the impact of GAN loss functions on the effectiveness of the generated images. We also analyze the robustness of classifiers trained on GAN and WGAN-generated datasets when subjected to adversarial attack methods. 

Our findings offer valuable insights into the influence of GAN loss functions on synthetic image quality and the subsequent improvements in Arabic Handwritten Digit recognition. Furthermore, our study sheds light on the resilience of classifiers trained on synthetic datasets generated by GAN and WGAN techniques, contributing to the ongoing development of more effective and robust image recognition systems.
