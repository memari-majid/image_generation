### Comparative Analysis of CVAE and CGAN for Image Generation to Improve OCR Systems
This GitHub repository contains code and resources for a comparative analysis of two popular deep learning frameworks, namely Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) and Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN), for generating synthetic images to enhance Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems. The goal is to investigate the performance of these models and determine their effectiveness in improving OCR accuracy.

### Project Structure
The project is organized into several Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks, including:

acgan and vae directories, which contain files for training the CVAE and CGAN models, respectively.
main, which defines the classification model architecture and training functions.
results, which contains generated images, classification metrics, and Saliency Maps for interpreting the classification.
README.md, which provides the project description and setup instructions.
